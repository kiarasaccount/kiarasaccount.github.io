      <h2>Who I am</h2>
      <p>Hello — In 2023, I graduated from University with a 2.1 in Economics. At this stage, I knew that I wanted to travel after studying, but would need money in order to fund it. I knew that self-employment would be the best way for me to do this but in order to be self employed, I needed to learn how to sell. 
I worked in Sales for 16 months (longer than expected but I really liked my team). Ultimately, the company was bought out, a lot of changes came from this so it was the perfect time for me to leave. <br> 
<br> 

During my time at the company, I had qualified as a L3 Personal Trainer. In January 2025, I left to travel - starting in Jamaica. Currently, I am no longer travelling, I am just working self- employed personal training. So why quit? <br> 
<br> 


I have always been ambitious and have always been curious to learn more information. Currently, I am taking piano lessons, because I want to push myself to learn something new. Personal training, just does not give me that sort of challenge. I am very lucky to have it as my job, but there is no next stage. Once you are fully booked with clients, thats it. No further knowledge is expected and no further career development is available.

I love coding. I love the satisfaction of finally fixing errors. I love that there is such a welcoming community of people willing to share their knowledge.
This is the career path that I want to take. welcoming community of people willing to share their knowledge.
This is the career path that I want to take. <br> 
<br> 


Outside of work I am very social, I like to exercise, spend time with friends. In work, I like to find something that I am passionate about, that I can fully immerse myself in to. </p>
